        I have been coding since I was 11, I learned Basic on a Tandy
        Radio-Shack TRS-80 with 16 Kb of RAM. In highschool I learned Pascal on
        the Apple IIe, and taught the Logo programming language to elementary
        and middle school students.

        Most of my professional life has been as a system admin (sysadmin) but
        at one time I was an expert RPG coder, maintaining custom modifications
        to ERP software on the IBM AS/400 platform (now known as the IBM eServer
        iSeries). Recently my experience has been mainly Powershell, C#, and
        SQL, specifically T-SQL which is the variant used in Microsoft's SQL
        Server and Sybase's SQLAnywhere.
