# Refactor of Horiseon Home Page

## Description

Week 1 of Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp has us refactoring a sample home page for a marketing agency.

For a demonstration please browse to my Github pages:
[https://chrispobrien.github.io]

Objectives include:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

For this homework exercise, accessibility standards are mainly adding alt text to images. I also changed a background image to a foreground image.

I changed all div elements into semantic html elements.

I used semantic html elements in a logical manner, following the structure of the page.

The switch from div elements to semantic elements allowed me to simplify the stylesheet and make it more understandable to the next coder.

Using Google Chrome's Lighthouse developer tool I realized the jpeg images were very large, so I resized them to the maximum size allowed in the stylesheet.

## Installation

Using git, issue the command:

git clone https://github.com/chrispobrien/chrispobrien.github.io.git

This will create the folder chrispobrien.github.io within which you will find index.html, this README.md file, and an assets folder containing a css folder for one stylesheet, style.css, and an images folder containing the images that appear on this page.

## Usage

Move or copy the contents of the folder chrispobrien.github.io into your web server's folder, for example in Microsoft IIS [c:\inetpub\wwwroot\] or (recommended) a subfolder like [c:\inetpub\wwwroot\week01\].
